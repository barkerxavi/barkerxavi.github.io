        <p>To start its best to find some reference as its difficult to predict how a volume might move.</p>
        <p>Once you have a good video or at least an image, figure out how the volume is moving and what is causing it (is there a fire causing an updraft or high windshear for example)</p>
        <p>For me I found a video of a large oil fire that was twisting and skewed off to one side due to the wind.</p>
        <p>Below you can see how I created velocity volumes to mimic the twisting motion.</p>
        <a href="initalSwirlVectorCreation.gif"><img src=initalSwirlVectorCreation.gif class="card" ></a>
        <p>At first i took inspiration from an impeller and used it to create a similar shape around the center of where I wanted my fire.</p>
        <p>Then I converted it to points using the tangent as a velocity vector. </p>
        <p>I moved these points in a random direction just a bit and then used a point replicate to fill out the area a bit.</p>
        <p>The gif below just shows the same operaions more or less but with the velocity vectors displayed.</p>
